# Agent Framework Sample Agent - Python

This sample demonstrates how to build an agent using Agent Framework in Python with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. It covers:

- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
- **Notifications**: Services and models for managing user notifications
- **Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools for building advanced agent solutions
- **Hosting Patterns**: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

This sample uses the [Microsoft Agent 365 SDK for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-python).

For comprehensive documentation and guidance on building agents with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK, including how to add tooling, observability, and notifications, visit the [Microsoft Agent 365 Developer Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/).

## Prerequisites
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Python](https://www.python.org/), supported versions: 3.11 or higher
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version
> - Prepare your own Azure OpenAI / OpenAI API credentials
> - Azure CLI signed in with `az login`

> - Microsoft Agent 365 SDK
> - Agent Framework (agent-framework-azure-ai)
> - A365 CLI: Required for agent deployment and management.

## Python Environment Configuration

Set up the Python virtual environment manually before running the agent or deploy steps:

1. Install `uv`:
	- `pip install uv`
2. Create a virtual environment:
	- `uv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
	- Windows PowerShell: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
	- macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Working with User Identity

On every incoming message, the A365 platform populates `activity.from_property` with basic user
information — always available with no API calls or token acquisition:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `activity.from_property.id` | Channel-specific user ID (e.g., `29:1AbcXyz...` in Teams) |
| `activity.from_property.name` | Display name as known to the channel |
| `activity.from_property.aad_object_id` | Azure AD Object ID — use this to call Microsoft Graph |

The sample logs these fields at the start of every message turn and injects the display name
into the LLM system instructions for personalized responses.

## Running the Agent in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>`, and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>` if you're using Azure OpenAI.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>` if you're using OpenAI.
1. In file *env/.env.playground*, fill in your custom app registration client id `CLIENT_APP_ID`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your agent in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an agent that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.

## Handling Agent Install and Uninstall

When a user installs (hires) or uninstalls (removes) the agent, the A365 platform sends an `InstallationUpdate` activity — also referred to as the `agentInstanceCreated` event. The sample handles this in `on_installation_update` in `host_agent_server.py`:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `add` | Agent was installed — send a welcome message |
| `remove` | Agent was uninstalled — send a farewell message |

```python
if action == "add":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for hiring me! Looking forward to assisting you in your professional journey!")
elif action == "remove":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for your time, I enjoyed working with you.")
```

To test with Agents Playground, use **Mock an Activity → Install application** to send a simulated `installationUpdate` activity.

## Sending Multiple Messages in Teams

Agent365 agents can send multiple discrete messages in response to a single user prompt in Teams. This is achieved by calling `send_activity` multiple times within a single turn.

> **Important**: Streaming responses are not supported for agentic identities in Teams. The SDK detects agentic identity and buffers the stream into a single message. Use `send_activity` directly to send immediate, discrete messages to the user.

The sample demonstrates this in `on_message` ([host_agent_server.py](host_agent_server.py)):

```python
# Message 1: immediate ack — reaches the user right away
await context.send_activity("Got it — working on it…")

# Send typing indicator immediately (awaited so it arrives before the LLM call starts).
await context.send_activity(Activity(type="typing"))

# Background loop refreshes the "..." animation every ~4s (it times out after ~5s).
async def _typing_loop():
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(4)
            await context.send_activity(Activity(type="typing"))
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass  # Expected on cancel.

typing_task = asyncio.create_task(_typing_loop())
try:
    response = await agent.process_user_message(...)
    # Message 2: the LLM response
    await context.send_activity(response)
finally:
    typing_task.cancel()
    try:
        await typing_task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
```

Each `send_activity` call produces a separate Teams message. You can call it as many times as needed to send progress updates, partial results, or a final answer.

### Typing Indicators

- Typing indicators show a "..." progress animation in Teams
- They have a built-in ~5-second visual timeout and must be refreshed in a loop every ~4 seconds
- Only visible in 1:1 chats and small group chats — not in channels
